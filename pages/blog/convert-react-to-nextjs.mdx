<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next.js?</h2>

First, what exactly is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)? From the official documentation... "*Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations. Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more.*"

So right off the bat we see that Next.js offers full-stack capabilities as opposed to React which is intended for front-end (e.g. browser) and SPA development. Created by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that allows fast development of user-friendly web applications and static websites, while also offering an out-of-the-box solution for server-side rendering (SSR) of React components. 

In other words any application you have that uses separate code bases for the front-end and back-end (e.g. React + Node/Express) can be replaced by Next.js - simplifying your application into one single project and streamlining communication across your stack.

<h2 id="react-vs-next">React vs Next.js</h2>

One key difference between React and Next.js already mentioned is React only offers client-side rendering, whereas Next.js allows for client-side, server-side, and static site generation on a per component basis. This level of flexibility makes development of full-stack applications highly customizable and offers numerous potential gains based on your app setup and needs.

Next.js offers great image Image optimization and SEO functionality out of the box as well as automatic code-splitting. Next.js is also highly customizable in project configuration and setup where React is much less configurable - unless you `eject` the project if using  *create-react-app* which in turns removes some of the advantages CRA provides in the first place.

Other key differences include:

In summary, while React is a library focused on building UI components, Next.js is a framework that extends React's capabilities by adding features like server-side rendering, routing, API handling, and other benefits to streamline the development process.

<h2 id="porting-steps">Migrating Your Code</h2>

Ready to convert your pure React project to Next.js? Wondering where to start? Similar to CRA for React projects, you can use `create-next-app` to quickly create and configure a new Next.js project from scratch.

<h3>Create a Next.js Project</h3>

To create a new Next.js project open a terminal and run the following command:

```properties
% npx create-next-app@latest
```
Running the above command will start an interactive prompt similar to the following:

```shell
% npx create-next-app@latest
✔ What is your project named? … my-app
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? … No / Yes
```

Make your selections based on your project configuration and needs. For example my projects are currently pure Javascript and I'm using Bulma for CSS so I selected *No* for Typescript and Tailwind options. I personally also usually opt to not create a separate */src* directory either to simplify the project structure and remove redundant folder levels.

After initial setup your project should look similar to the following:

```
├── app
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── globals.css
│   ├── layout.js
│   ├── page.js
│   ├── page.module.css
├── public
│   ├── next.svg
│   └── vercel.svg
├── jsconfig.json
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
└── .eslintrc.json
```

Now you can install project dependencies:

```properties
% npm install
```

And run the project in local development mode:

```properties
% npm run dev
```

You can view the running app by going to `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser, you should see the following:

<div className="container">
  <Image
    alt='react-to-nextjs'
    src='/img/create-next-app.png'
    priority
    width={0}
    height={0}
    sizes="100vw"
    style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</div>

<h3>Copy Source Files</h3>

Now you are ready to copy your existing source files into your new project. Since Next.js supports React components you can copy-paste your existing components into the `/app` folder in your new project with minimal or sometimes no changes needed. Or you can copy your source files into a different level project directory, however note the following:

> Next.js components are configured to render server-side by default so for any React components that need to be rendered client-side (for example they use browser APIs such as fetch or local storage) you will need to add the `'use client'` directive to the top of said source file. [More Info](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components)

For instance, if you have the following generic component that uses the browser fetch API:

```jsx
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react'

export default function MyComponent() {

  const [data, setData] = useState("")
  
  useEffect(() => {
    async function getData() {
      await fetch("https://some.domain")
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data.message))
    }
    getData()
  },[])

  ...
}
```

You would need to add the `'use client'` directive to the top of the source file for it to function properly:

```jsx
'use client'

import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react'
...
```

As with other code ports, you may also need to update some of your `import ...` statements across your code base since references to resources like images and CSS files may have changed with the new project structure.

<h3>Add Scripts (optional)</h3>

Next.js supports global scripts and metadata imports as well on a per layout basis (e.g. for a subset of routes). For simplicity we show how to add a global script to your Next.js project below.

Let's say you had the following script defined in your previous project's *index.html* file:

```html
<head>
  <script src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-123456789" data-nscript="lazyOnload"></script>
</head>
```

In your Next.js project open `/app/layout.js` and add the following import at the top:

```javascript
import Script from 'next/script'
```

Now we can use the `<Script>` component to import the global script in our Next.js app:

```javascript
import Script from 'next/script'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
import './globals.css'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Create Next App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
}

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
      <Script 
        src="https://https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-123456789" strategy="lazyOnload"
      />
    </html>
  )
}
```
(*For more information on importing and optimizing scripts see the Next.js [scripts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts) page.*)

By now hopefully you've ironed out any remaining errors and you're able to run your new Next.js app. If you still have some compilation or run-time issues  the Next.js [Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) are great place to start.

<h2 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and Tricks</h2>

### Images

Next.js offers strong image capabilities and optimizations through the [Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image) component. If you have a lot of images in your app it's a good idea to go through and replace them with the Image component so you can take advantage of optimizations and other benefits. Here's its basic usage:

```javascript
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/profile.png"
      width={500}
      height={500}
      alt="Picture of the author"
    />
  )
}
```

#### Note on Hero Images

If you have a hero image on any of your pages there's some extra properties you will need to set along with some styling to make it work properly and take up the whole screen. After lots of reading and tinkering I finally got full-screen heros working with the following code:

```javascript
export default function FullScreenHero(props) => {

  return (
    <div style={{position:'relative',width:'100vw',height:'100vh'}}>
      <Image
        priority
        src={`/path/to/hero.png`}
        fill
        style={{objectFit:"cover"}}
        alt="full-screen-hero"
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The `priority` property tells Next.js this image accounts for the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) on this page and to therefore prioritize loading of this image. Also note the extra `fill` and `style` properties as well as some extra CSS styling on the parent div which are required (e.g. parent div must have *relative* positioning). 

### Global CSS imports

If your previous React project imported global CSS/SCSS files across multiple source files then you may need to refactor some of those imports. In Next.js global style imports are <span className="has-text-weight-bold">only</span> allowed under the `/app` source folder, meaning you may need to move source files around or update your styling imports.

In addition to global styling Next.js also supports *CSS Modules*, *Tailwind CSS*, *Sass*, and *CSS-in-JS*, see the [styling](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling) page for more info.



### Production Builds

To create an optimized production build use the `next build` command by running:

```properties
% npm run build
```

This creates a production ready build that can be self hosted on a Node.js server, Docker Image, or as static HTML files (see [deployment](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying)). However you may notice no traditional build folder is generated by the command. To do so we must explicitly tell Next.js to create one. Open `next.config.js` and add `output: 'export'` to the *nextConfig* object like so:

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

Now when you run <span className="has-text-weight-bold">npm run build</span> a new `/out` folder will be generated at the root of your project that contains your production build's static assets.

-----

Hopefully this article has helped you convert your existing React project into a Next.js app and you are reaping some of the benefits the Next.js framework offers. Plus with Next.js you now have a foundation to start adding any backend / API routes to your app - all within the same code base.
